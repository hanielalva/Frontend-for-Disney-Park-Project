# Frontend-for-Disney-Park-Project
Frontend for Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path based Disney Park Java Project

This repository displays my work right before integrating with my other project partners. All of the files were my own creation, except for the interface files IAttraction.java and IDisneyParkBackend.java, which were created by my partners Henry and Anton. They were the Backend developers and their interfaces were used to make the placeholder classes that I used to run my Frontend program. 

Two other java classes were used to run the Disney Park application, but they have to be omitted from this public repository as it has sensitive code that is against project policy to share.

Each file and each method in these files have detailed comments about their use
