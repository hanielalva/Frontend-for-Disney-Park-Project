# Frontend-for-Disney-Park-Project
Frontend for Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path based Disney Park Java Project

This repository displays my work right before integrating with my other project partners. Most of the files were my own creation. The interface files IAttraction.java and IDisneyParkBackend.java were created by my partners Henry and Anton who were the Backend developers of the project. Their interfaces were used to make the placeholder classes that I used to run my Frontend program before integrating with the whole project. IDisneyParkFrontend.java was made by myself and Sreyas, the other Frontend Developer.

One other java class and interface, that the Disney Park application depends on to run, have to be omitted from this public repository. This is because they have sensitive code that is against project policy to share.

Each file and each method in these files have detailed comments about their use
